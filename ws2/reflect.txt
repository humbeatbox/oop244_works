This workshop very clearly showed us how to do the polymorphism.
Beginning with the chaos of the whole thing, it's hard for me to know and understand why we need different functions with the same name.
After I tried a lot of different way(like draw a diagram of flow and process data diagram), I finally understand how the instruction's meaning.
I assume that I can't quickly figure it out because I do not fully know how to get data in Employee.cpp from the File.cpp instead of using a different type of function read() in Employee.cpp directly.
This also led to me going crazy at that time.
However, I recognize it is so easy when I know the whole concept and meaning of polymorphism and can use the new way(what File is do) to module.
Another thing is how to use a pointer in reading a file and how different between the pass by value and pass by reference(using pointer).
