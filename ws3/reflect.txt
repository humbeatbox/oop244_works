Because of a lack of practice in C++ coding structure, I spent half an hour trying to find every time we needed to implement the code.
We need to use the namespace at the beginning and the class name at the front of the function to make sure the compiler can
recognize which it belongs to. Therefore, we can make a method called the helping function that allows the object to access the variable
within the limit. For standard function library, we need to very clearly about the function to prevent the run time error.
I spent a lot of time debugging the init problem because I misunderstood the strncpy function about how to copy the string correctly.
However, if we copy the string from a string with the number of characters over the target of the number of characters, it 
will end up with an error(not '\0'). This means the string not a good string and might lead to the run time error.
