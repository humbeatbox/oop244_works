In this workshop one , the most important part that I learned is not the module but namespace.
Because we have already used the modular design in C language, I know how the important to separate the different function to the same file.
However, the concept of name space is my the first time use in the program.
Beginning with forgetting use the namespace in the header file, it spent me a lot of time to solve the problem.
After many times of test and learn in the website, I finally make it correct.
I think this is because we need to create and prototype in the header file and implement it in the cpp file.
If we don't give a clear definition for the prototype by using the name space, compiler can't recognize which program that we implement belonging to.
The other thing that I focus is that we need to make sure the operating system that the user use to prevent the error.
